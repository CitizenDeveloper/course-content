# context
The difference between data and information is basically visualization.

Visualising data isn't as easy as it seems in the movies.  There's the whole bit about choosing the data you're focusing on and then making it look meaningful. In fact, data visualization is so specific to the data that we'll treat this activity a little differently.

In this activity we'll play with hundreds of visualizations and dozens of data sets to help us practice combining the two.
