# context
The data we collect often ends up trapped in one system or another and, although we can export the data from most systems, it's a batch process that happens periodically and often manually.

An alternative to batch export is realtime data export, or what we're calling "data in motion".

SaaS services support data in motion through integration points like APIs and webhooks.

In this activity we'll use state of the art SaaS services to move data from the point of collection to other systems where we can continue to add to and benefit from the value of our data.

Get to know Zapier

Zapier connects any two (of over 400 available) services together.

To do this, you configure a "Zap" which basically combines triggers from one service with actions from another service.

Whenever the trigger event occurs, Zapier automatically completes the action for you.
