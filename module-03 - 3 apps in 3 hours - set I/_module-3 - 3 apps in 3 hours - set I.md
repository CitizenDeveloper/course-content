# description
Building applications using SaaS services basically boils down to two repeatable steps:
- configuring a service
- connecting it to other services

The lessons learned from developing large, complex systems led to developers prizing modularity, simplicity, and extensibility over monolithic design.

In the spirit of these design philosophy, you'll be playing with small, modular and extensible SaaS services that will let you compose flexible applications very quicky.

In this module you will learn to identify, use, and compare services meant for the collection, transformation, storage, and analysis of data.

# learning objectives

By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Collect data for use in an application
- Transform and move data between applications
- Manage the state of data and store it for later retrieval
- Analyze data and create compelling visualizations and reports with it

# agenda:

- [Working with Data Collection](/activity-3-1)
- [Working with Data in Motion](/activity-3-2)
- [Working with Data Lifecycle Management](/activity-3-3)
- [Working with Data Visualization](/activity-3-4)

# pair and share

## Consider your experience working with each of these systems

- Are the systems easy to learn, well documented and supported by a community?
- Are the systems supportive and forgiving in their user experience, offering inline help and hints along the way?
- Are they sensible and predictable in their "design intent" in that you can make sense of what is happening while building?

## Consider the points of greatest confusion while working with these systems

- How did you resolve a point of confusion?
- What would you change about the most confusing parts of these systems?
- What kind of ongoing training and practice would be needed to maintain a reasonable level of comfort with these systems?

# success criteria
- I can construct a form and use it to collect data
- I can connect systems together and move data among them
- I can manage data using moderation, comments and tasks
- I can create visualizations of various shapes of data
- I can predict the user experience produced by all of the above
