# context
Data lifecycle management, managing the movement of data and metadata among people and systems, is also called a "workflow" or "process".

While raw data itself is valuable, we often want to manage some kind of process around the data in order to control and augment the data with metadata from collection through archival.

In this activity we'll use a state of the art data lifecycle management system to collect and manage the movement of data through a controlled process including tasks, comments and changes in metadata.
