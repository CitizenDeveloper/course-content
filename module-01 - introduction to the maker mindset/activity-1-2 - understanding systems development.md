# context
As a software developer, it's our responsibility to make a series of decisions about the systems we build that lead to a high quality, performant solution.

By understanding the kinds of trade-offs that are made every day by systems designers and developers, we become better at communicating our needs in terms that are realistic and therefore more likely to be well received.

In this activity we'll consider these trade-offs.

# stepwise

1. defined vs emprical processes

4. establishing realistic expectations

given that we now know about different kinds of processes, development contexts and underlying technology contraints, how can we best communicate our needs to a software development team?

# discussion

- How does the nature of a defined process make it easier for us to predict?
- Why is greenfield development so much easier than brownfield development?
- Is there a "correct" or "best" technology stack?
- What is state-of-the-art in software development planning and expectation setting?
