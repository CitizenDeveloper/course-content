# context
When we talk about the maker mindset we really mean something like "seeing a world of possibilities" and "never giving up".

As children we experimented with our environments relentlessly, often upsetting parents and siblings in the process. The designers and creators of the systems we use did not wait for permission to change the world, they worked within the constraints imposed on them to effect the changes they hoped to see.

In this activity you will be exposed to the leading evidence-based drivers of high performance learning and the maker mindset -- how to stay playfully curious in the face of utter confusion.
