# description

As non-technical users, most of our interactions with computers are based on a very consistent frame of reference: we set a goal and then, often within seconds, we succeed.

This success-mode view of systems is actually intended by the maker, but blocks us from experiencing a deeper, richer relationship with the systems we use every day.

This collection of activities will invite you to reconsider your relationship with the systems around you and to make a very deliberate investment in reframing that relationship.

Further, we'll explore the qualities of high performance learning: embracing confusion like an Olympian athelete embraces training.
