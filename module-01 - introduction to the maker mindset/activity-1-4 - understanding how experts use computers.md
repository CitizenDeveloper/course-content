# context
Software developers leverage thousands of small, cumulative bits of tacit knowledge about how systems work (as well as many tools and tricks) to make their interaction with the computer as expressive and streamlined as possible.

In this activity we'll discuss a few of these fundamental patterns of usage and their origins to help you gain more control over your computing experience.

# stepwise

> [demo: breadth vs depth (20 mins)]

- content search and discovery
  - advanced google and gmail search
  - opening up search results in multiple tabs
  - skimming documentation before reading anything in great detail
  - skimming several books for relevant topics
  - reading multiple sources on the same topic to gain perspective

- system construction
  - stubbing out system interfaces before deeper implementation
  - composing generic tools to mock a system before building anything custom
  - evaluating open source software using github artifacts

> [demo: expert visual cues (5 mins)]

A critical difference between experts and novices is that experts know what to ignore.  By focusing their attention on the most important details they come to lightning-fast conclusions about complex problems using something like intuition.
