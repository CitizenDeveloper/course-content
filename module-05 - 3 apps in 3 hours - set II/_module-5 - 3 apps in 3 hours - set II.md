# description
The lessons learned from developing large, complex systems led to developers prizing modularity, simplicity, and extensibility over monolithic design.

In the spirit of these design philosophy, you'll be playing with small, modular and extensible SaaS services that will let you compose flexible applications very quicky.

In this module you will learn to identify, use, and compare services meant for the collection, transformation, storage, and analysis of data.

# learning objectives
- Collect data for use in an application
- Transform and move data between applications
- Manage the state of data and store it for later retrieval
- Analyze data and create compelling visualizations and reports with it

# agenda
- [Defend Data Collection](/activity-5-1)
- [Defend Data in Motion](/activity-5-2)
- [Defend Data Lifecycle Management](/activity-5-3)
- [Defend Data Visualization](/activity-5-4)

# pair and share

### Discuss you personal lessons of expertise
- Which SaaS service did you use and what did you learn about it?
- What did you struggle with and how did you overcome it?
- What were you not able to understand or accomplish?

### Discuss your personal experience of building
- What did you build?
- How long did it take?
- Did your plans change along the way?
- What would you have done differently?
