# context
Beyond collecting, moving and managing data, we eventually want to design and build meaningful views into the data so that we can extract meaningful information.

In this activity you will explore several data sets, visualizations and tools that experts use to explore and visualize their data.

# stepwise

1. play with d3 cards and viz
2. play with raw / similar
3. look at examples of good vs. bad visualizations

# discussion

- How do you use data visualization in your organization?
- Which charts and graphs resonate with you the most and why?
