# description

As part of your experience with this course you've used systems to register for the class, complete surveys and other activities.

These systems are built using the very tools that you'll be learning about and using to build your own applications.

This module peels back the curtain on the work you've done so far to show more more about the systems that work together to manage the experience you've had up to this point.

# learning objectives

By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Identify each of the systems used by this course
- Recognize how the systems used by this course fit together
- Estimate the effort required to build the surveys and other systems used by this course
- Survey and classify the various systems into meaningful groups that are easy to reason about

# agenda

- [Exploring Data Collection](/activity-2-1)
- [Exploring Data in Motion](/activity-2-2)
- [Exploring Data Lifecycle Management](/activity-2-3)
- [Exploring Data Visualization](/activity-2-4)

# pair and share

## Consider the utility of these systems

- Do any of the features surprise or impress you in some way?
- What applications can you imagine building with these systems?
- What systems are you using now that might be augmented or replaced by these systems?

## Consider the costs and benefits of using these systems

- What are some of the benefits of using these systems?
- What are a few of the costs?
- What are the major risks in using systems like these?

# success criteria

- I recognize how these systems were used to build the various parts of this course
- I can describe how each of these systems serves a purpose
- I recognize some of the costs, benefits, risks and limitations of these systems
- I can classify these (and similar) systems into meaningful groups to help make sense of many such systems working together
