# context
It's rare that we simply want to collect data for its own sake.  It's much more common to collect data and immediately subject it to moderation, approval, cleaning, analysis and a host of other value adding actions.

In this activity we'll explore what it means to move data using the tools that were built with this course

# stepwise

1. send a notification from FluidSurveys

2. configure a webhook from FluidSurveys

3. add a specific Zapier integration to FluidSurveys


# discussion

- What is meant by "data in motion" exactly?
- Discuss a specific example of data in motion from your workplace
- Contrast the connectors we used in Wufoo directly vs. the connectors provided by Zapier
