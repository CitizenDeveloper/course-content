# description
"If something is usable it means that a person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than itâ€™s worth."   
-- *Steven Krug, Don't Make Me Think!*

In this module you will explore patterns of sensible design and apply your learning by translating an idea into a minimal viable product with prototyping tools.

# learning objectives

### Consider your reactions to design
- Does good design induce an emotional reaction in you?
- How can your designs do the same for others?
- Would you consider keeping a logbook of great designs you encounter?

### Consider your work on an MVP
- Do you find it difficult to limit yourself to an MVP?
- Are there other ways to express your ideas and collect user feedback?
