From your triage results, pick two especially good ones and two especially bad ones. Assemble an argument about the merits and/or detriments of each.

Recall the Trunk Test. Can you easily answer these questions?

1. What site is this? (Site ID)
2. What page am I on? (Page name)
3. What are the major sections of this site? (Sections)
4. What are my options at this level? (Local navigation)
5. Where am I in the scheme of things? (“You are here” indicators)
6. How can I search?

# discussion

- [10 min] In small groups, share and defend your judgements of the sites you reviewed above.

- [5 mins] As a large group, debrief
  - Were there any major disagreements or clashes of opinion in your small groups?
  - What were the common conventions from your small group discussion?
