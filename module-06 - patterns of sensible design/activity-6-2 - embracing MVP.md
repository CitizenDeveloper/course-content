# context
**Definitions of Minimum Viable Product (MVP) vary, including:**

> A Minimum Viable Product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.

> A Minimum Viable Product is the smallest thing you can build that delivers customer value (and as a bonus captures some of that value back).

> A minimum viable product is “that product which has just those features and no more that allows you to ship a product that early adopters see and, at least some of whom resonate with, pay you money for, and start to give you feedback on”.

> A minimum viable product is a development technique in which a new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. The final, complete set of features is only designed and developed after considering feedback from the product's initial users.

In this activity we will practice defining minimal viable products.

# stepwise
1. (10 minutes) Skim this article, *The Ultimate Guide to Minimal Viable Products*
  http://scalemybusiness.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-minimum-viable-products/

---

2. (10 minutes) It's your turn to define a minimal viable product. Choose one of the following ideas (or use that great app idea you've been dreaming about!) and describe an MVP
  - I want to find the closest local coffee shop, fast
  - I like wine, but I always buy the same two kinds because I don't like standing in the wine aisle looking like a lost puppy. Help me improve my wine-game.

Remember, keep it minimal
> The key is to restate any hard problem that requires a lot of software into a simple problem that requires much less. You may not be solving exactly the same problem but that’s alright. Solving 80% of the original problem for 20% of the effort is a major win. The original problem is almost never so bad that it’s worth five times the effort to solve it.

3. (15 minutes) Form groups of 3. Pitch your MVP's and give one-another constructive feedback.

Things to consider:
- Would you want to use this product?
- What technologies do you need? Do you know how to use all of them?
- What other barriers might you face in creating this MVP?
- What makes this minimal?

---

4. (5 minutes) In your small group, choose one MVP to improve upon together.  Make it really good, you're going to prototype and present to the whole group next!

# discussion

- What have you concluded makes "good design"?
- What systems in your daily work could improve with a design makeover and how, specifically?
