# context
To build software that survives the tests of time, it's absolutely critical to consider the work from an engineering perspective.  Engineers close the gap between theory and practice by considering the lifetime context in which they create their good works.

IEEE defines software engineering as: "the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software".

In this activity we'll explore how engineers think and how to approach software development from an engineering perspective.

- how we built the tools for this course under SaaS constraints
  - service constraints and pricing tiers
  - technical constraints on integration
  - learning constraints on complexity

- given all the options we have
- given all the constraints of the above
- which is the best choice? speed to implement vs difficulty to maintain

> [discuss: build-measure-iterate]

> [discuss: applications vs systems]

- applications tend to be monolithic, idiosyncratic, custom built and harder to maintain
- systems tend to be multi-part, generic, composable, etc..


# discussion

- How would you define software engineering?
- What is more expensive: building or maintaining a software program?
- How can you minimize the maintenance costs of a production application?
