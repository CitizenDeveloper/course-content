# context
Consider the software that you use everyday in your office, your phone, your car and your home.  What about this software engenders trust?  Is it aesthetics or some deeper patterns that are only noticeable through repeated use?

In this activity we'll explore several attributes of software quality with an aim to better understand how these qualities affect us and our software designs.

"The Wideband Delphi estimation method is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort. It derives from the Delphi method which was developed in the 1950-1960s at the RAND Corporation as a forecasting tool. It has since been adapted across many industries to estimate many kinds of tasks, ranging from statistical data collection results to sales and marketing forecasts"
