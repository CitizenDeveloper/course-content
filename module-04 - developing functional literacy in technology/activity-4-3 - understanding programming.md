# context
Movies have popularized programmers as wizards, regardless of whether they are good or evil, attractive or repulsive, effective or bumbling.  Somehow they're always wizards doing a wizard's work.

Real programmers are less like wizards and more like car designers, mechanics, technicians and expert drivers.

Programming is a process is repeated failure, so much so that a vast majority of modern programmers have embraced failure as a step along the critical path to success.  They do this using a software development process known as TDD, or Test Driven Development.

In this activity we'll observe a pair of software developers working through a programming problem.

# stepwise

> [demo: greenfield software production (20 mins)]

- Observe a pair programming session
- Estimate the costs of production using [wideband delphi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wideband_delphi)

---

> [demo: brownfield software maintenance (20 mins)]
 
- Observe a software developer debugging a program
- Estimate the costs of maintenance using [wideband delphi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wideband_delphi)
  
# discussion

- What impressions did you have of the production and maintenance of software?
- Given your observations of programmers in action, how might this influence some of your future conversations with developers?
- What would help make the process of software production more transparent and inclusive of non-developers?
